As such, it supports the following operations: `push`, `get_min`, `get_max`, `pop_min`, `pop_max` where insertion takes amortized O(log n) time, removal takes O(log n) time and accessing minimum and maximum can be done in constant time. Also, other convenient functions are provided that handle conversion from and into vectors and allow iteration etc."],["Iter","`IntervalHeap` iterator."]]});
